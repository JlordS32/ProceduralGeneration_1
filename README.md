# This repo is officially dropped

## Notes
---

I am dropping this project due to the increased in complexity.
My current experience and knowledge with Unity is currently limiting my ability in 
making the procedurally generated world I envisioned possible. (I may come back into this
later down the line)

Learning WFC and Noise Generation was good, I've learned a lot, and can confidently say
that I know the basics of ProcGen by now. However the aim that I had for this project seemed
more complexed that I have thought. After about 60 hours into this project I have come to realise
that I'm spending too much time going circles. This shows my lack of experience of understanding.
Thus I have considered stepping back and learning how Unity works as I'm wasting too much time
thinking and solving the problems I have with this project. While it may seem that cowardly,
to me a it's a strategical retreat. 

For now I'll do other more projects and gather as much experience possible.

#### TL:DR; The bottleneck was me.

# This repo is officially dropped

## Notes
---

I am dropping this project due to the increased in complexity.
My current experience and knowledge with Unity is currently limiting my ability in 
making the procedurally generated world I envisioned possible. (I may come back into this
later down the line)

Learning WFC and Noise Generation was good, I've learned a lot, but dealing with procedurally
generated tiles and placing them into the grid was the greatest challenge I've ever faced.

I have considered and stepping back and learning how Unity works as I'm wasting too much time
as thinking and solving the problems I have with this project. While it may seem that cowardly,
to me a it's a strategical retreat.
